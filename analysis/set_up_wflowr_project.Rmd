```

In this vignette, we will go through how to set up a workflowr project.

### Step 1

Go to Kaiqian's github page and create a new repo called "myproject".

### Step 2

Choose a directory to `git clone github-link-for-myproject-repo`. Now this directory contains a folder called `myproject`.

### Step 3

Open R and in the R console, set the directory to the directory mentioned in step 2. Under this directory,

```
setwd("step2-directory")

library(workflowr)

wflow_start("myproject", existing=TRUE)

wflow_build()

```

### Step 4

Open `myproject` folder to see that we have a Rproj existed already now. Open Rproj and edit `analysis/index.Rmd` and then 

```
wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd", "analysis/about.Rmd", "analysis/license.Rmd"), "first commit for this project.")

```

### Step 5

In the terminal, go into `myproject` folder and 

```
git push
```

### Step 6

Go to Kaiqian's github, under `Settings` -> `Github Pages` -> Choose `Source` -> `master branch /docs folder` to get the project link. Put the link in the repo description. Done!
