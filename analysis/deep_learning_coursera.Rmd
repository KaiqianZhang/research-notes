* train set and development set should come from the same distribution.

* if the algorithm has bias or variance problem?
Suppose the base error is 0% for classifying cat vs non-cat by human eyes. 

  - If the train set error is 1% and the development set error is 15%, the algorithm is overfitting the data. So it has high variance. 
  
  - If the train set error is 15% and the development set error is 16%, the algorithm is underfitting the data. So it has high bias.
