We usually want to perform large-scale simulations on clusters. And as a research beginner, running my code on cluster is really a neck of pain. Here I take notes on how to use UChicago's rcc clusters. The simulation tool I am using is DSC, Dynamic Statistical Comparisons, from Matthew Stephens lab. DSC provides a framework for managing computational benchmarking experiments that compare several competing methods for a task across datasets or simulation scenarios.

## Run simulations using DSC

Suppose I git push a new version of my R package `susieR` and I want to run simulations using this R package on clusters.

* step 1: log into my rcc account

```
ssh kaiqianz@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu
```

I will need to enter my password.

* step 2: load R and git clone repo for my R package. I also need to install the local version `susieR` in the R

```
module load R/3.5.1 
```

cd to the directory I want to clone the repo,

```
git clone URL the-name-I-like-for-R-package
```

Then I can open R and devtools::install() the local R package

```
cd the-name-I-like-for-R-package

R

install.package('devtools')

devtools::install()

library(susieR)

q()
```

* step 3: before running DSC, we'd better get onto an interactive node on cluster to perform large-scale simulations. I list three kinds of commands I have tried over the summer.

```
sinteractive --partition=mstephens --time=24:00:00 --mem=8G

sinteractive --exclusive --partition=broadwl --nodes=1 --time=24:00:00 

sinteractive --partition=mstephens --time=48:00:00 --mem=64G â€”cpus-per-task=28
```

* step 4: go to the DSC repo, which is a repo I created for simulation code. In this case, we have `dsc-susie`. We can first run a truncate version to see if this works before large-scale simulations.

```
cd dsc-susie

dsc benchmark.dsc target susie_v --truncate
```
After we pass the truncate version, we can run everything.

```
dsc benchmark.dsc target susie_v --replicate 50 -c 16
```

## Retrieve results from DSC and clusters or debug

Here we would use online python notebook to connect my cluster and easily open my simulation results. Note that I have `jupyterlab-server` installed on my midway. 

```
cd jupyterlab-server

sbatch jupyter-lab.sbatch 
```

I would see `Submitted batch job 57433075`.

```
cat nb-log-57433075.out
```

I would get a command start with `ssh` and a website looks like `localhost:9148`. Now open a new terminal and get on midway again and paste that `ssh` command. 

```
ssh kaiqianz@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu

ssh -N -L 9148:10.50.221.3:9148 kaiqianz@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu -v
```

Then we can open the website `localhost:9148` on google chrome. To retrieve the token asked from the website, we do

```
cat nb-log-57433075.err
```
to get the token.

Now we are ready to go. We have all simulation results in python notebook so that we can do analysis!
